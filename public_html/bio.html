            <h2>Musical style</h2>
            <hr>
            <p> Trivium has been described as heavy metal, metalcore, thrash metal,progressive metal, melodic death metal and groove metal.

                Their style has evolved over the years from their earliest work on Ember to Inferno right through to In Waves, there is a clear thrash influence from Metallica and Machine Head, as well as some early In Flames.
            </p>
            <p>
            Upon the release of their second album Ascendancy,Trivium were identified as melodic metalcore with strong elements of thrash metal, with the third track on the album “Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr” becoming a permanent fixture in the band's set lists and the rest of the album selling itself to gold status. Ascendancy was even featured as one of Metal Hammer’s Albums of the Decade. Later releases have marked changes in the band. The Crusade was seen as a major shift in musical direction due to the change in vocal style, namely the absence of screaming, and some of the melodies featured.

                The Crusade is a much more thrash-oriented album and lyrical content was also different in direction, citing current affairs, such as the famous killings. In Autumn 2008, Trivium released Shogun, which has a heavy Japanese influence on its title track as well as the first single release "Kirisute Gomen", which translates to "authorization to cut and leave". Acknowledging Matt Heafy’s Japanese heritage, the album also was described more favorably as more their own style, as previous references to Trivium sounding like Metallica had been made on the back of The Crusade. The Crusade made sparing use of seven-string guitars, which were featured heavily on Shogun. Seven-string guitars once again returned on Silence in the Snow and The Sin and the Sentence.

            On In Waves, the band featured a sound closer to Ascendancy than The Crusade and Shogun and features their more melodic metalcore sound than thrash metal. The guitar tuning instead of being in Drop D, they went half a step lower to drop C#. The album has several songs, such as 'Built to Fall' or 'Dusk Dismantled', featuring solely clean vocals or screamed vocals from Matt Heafy.

                Trivium's music mixes "soaring" and "crushing" riffs, dual guitar harmonies, double bass drum patterns and occasional blast beats and breakdowns that one can expect from the metalcore genre. Vocally Trivium combines both singing along with heavy screaming and growls. Trivium is one of the notable New Wave of American Heavy Metal acts.

                    Heafy was born in Iwakuni, Japan. Although Heafy was born in Japan, he lived there for only one year. He does not speak Japanese fluently; however, he has mastered some of the basic phrases and uses them when he performs in Japan. His family then moved to Orlando, Florida, where he currently resides. Heafy attended Lake Brantley High School. He completed his senior year while also touring in Europe, and graduated in 2004. During those years, Heafy used to live a straight edge lifestyle.

                    Heafy learned to play the tenor saxophone in years leading up to becoming more serious on guitar at the age of eleven. At that period he was mostly listening to pop punk bands and even auditioned for a local one called "Freshly Squeezed" by playing the Blink-182 song Dammit. However, following his audition, he never got a follow-up call back. He also cites being introduced to heavy metal by his classmate, David, who gave him a copy of Metallica's self-titled album.

                <p>
                    Heafy does not know formal music theory and was almost completely self-taught. He does know how to read sheet music, but can only apply it on the saxophone. However, in 2015, he started taking formal training for the guitar.

                    "Self-taught for quite a bit of it, did lessons on and off for maybe two or three years, but I do not know anything formal music on guitar. I do on saxophone though…but that doesn’t help me on guitar."

                <p>
                    On January 10, 2010, Heafy married Ashley Howard in Orlando, Florida. The wedding was attended by close friends and family.

                    Matt still often uses the same first Gibson Les Paul he got from his father, but only in studio settings. For live performances he uses his signature Epiphone Les Paul that is modeled off of his Gibson.

                    Paolo Gregoletto joined Trivium on September 5, 2004 when Matt Heafy, Corey Beaulieu and Travis Smith were in the studio demoing new material for what would become Ascendancy.

After jamming with other members, Gregoletto agreed to record for Ascendancy and tour to promote it with the band.

                    Bent was born in 1993 in Oakland, California. When Bent turned 11 years of age, he asked his father to assemble his old drum kit. After teaching himself how to perform percussion for just over one year, he competed in drum competitions and auditioned for various musical ensembles.

                    When the drummer turned 15, he performed with Marching Band, Concert Band, Jazz Band, Modesto Junior College Jazz Band in addition to other local musical groups. Within the next 3 years, he participated in the Guitar Center Drum Off making it to Regional Finals.

                    In 2011, the percussionist joined Arkaik, touring with Decrepit Birth in 2012 and becoming a settled member of Brain Drill and Dragonlord in 2015.

                    In April 2015, American blue collar metal band Battlecross employed Bent for their "Summer Of Doom Tour" with Crowbar and Lord Dying. Later that year, Bent filled in for Gene Hoglan of Testament.

                    At the recommendation of producer Mark Lewis, Trivium had Bent audition for the role as their new percussionist, replacing outgoing session drummer Paul Wandtke. In January 2017, Trivium confirmed Bent as their drummer for their February 2017 European tour with Sikth.
